Assignment: Homework 7 Problem 2
Source Code: HomeworkSevenProblem2.java
Class: Online Section 35101
Action: User enters an integer between 1 and 100. The program calls two
functions in order calculate odd or even status and to calculate the factorial 
summation. The values are returned to the main and then displayed in the 
output. 
Build Time: 2 hours 45 minutes.
Notes: Entering a character will cause the program to stop... by crashing. 
I wonder if there is a way to stop the program upon input of a character
without crashing. Also, it'd be useful if I could store these functions 
somewhere for use in other programs.
