Class: Online Section 35101
Action: I've been asked to write a program to determine GPA based on two 
courses and a 4.0 scale.
Note: This assignment kicked my ass.

/* ********************Three Step Analysis***********************************
1)Write a program the calculates GPA on two classes using a 4.0 scale. No
No plus or minus grades. We'll assume the user enters a capital letter, so 
so no need to test for upper case. Needs to display letter grade and the 
number of credits for each class. Value of the GPA is displayed along with a 
message if you have a low or high GPA. 

2)Inputs                           Outputs                        Equations
LetterGrade1st                  Letter grade                       if else
LetterGrade2nd                  Credit Hours        TotalCreditHours = (CreditHours1st + CreditHours2nd)
TotalPoints                     GPA                GPA = (CreditHours1st*LetterGrade1st)+
TotalCreditHours                                   (CreditHours2nd*LetterGrade2nd))/TotalCreditHours)
CreditHours1st
CreditHours2nd

3)No limits.
