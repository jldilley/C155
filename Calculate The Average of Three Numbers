Program #: 2
Source Code: Program2.java
Class: Online Section 35101
Action: This was the second program given to us by Professor Holloway. It declares and initializes three variables and assigns them to the 
Average identifier. I learned how to declare and initialize a set of variables that share a data type on the same line. I also learned that psvm and sout
are short cuts for the main and print line commands, respectively.
